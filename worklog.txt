## 04-04:
FastQC run on DNA_trimmed samples.

FastQC run on RNA_untrimmed.

Started working on batch script for DNA assembly. Problems with paths using SBATCH, what is the working directory when a batch is run??

## 04-05

Kept working on the assembly script, tried using absolute paths instead of relative paths.

Re-ran FastQC on the RNA after it had been separated into forward and reverse reads.

## sporadic during the week:

Ran assemblies, had trouble with the output directory existing or hving the wrong priveleges.

## 04-10

Assembly done.

## 04-11 

inspecting assembly/ starting binning

## 04-12
Binning done

## 04-24 and 25

Sick.

## 05-02

Realized i had made the wrong assembly (two separate instead of one). Also made a script for CheckM for later when I the assembly is done.

## 05 - 13

I've restarded the assembly from scratch as I realized that I had been working with two separate assemblies instead of one.
I haf tried to bin them both into one set of bins but apparantly the software only read the first assembly.
I've been keeping working with my "faulty" bins parallelly, so that I'm 100% that my scripts work and I can just keep running the joined assembly smoothly.

So far the new assembly is binned and the old one has been run through prokka.

## -05 -16

During the week I ahve had problems with batch being completed but ourfiles being empty. final.contigs.fa from megahit was empty, and both checkM and metabat produced empty folders.
The CheckM/Metabat was just due to the outfiles being without names and being named only .19.fa etc made them invisible.

The Assembly not creating outfiles remains. the kMax iterations should be the same as the output file so I'm binning that. Also remved a bunch of files and trying one more assembly 
to see if the problem magically solves itself the same way it magically appeared.

Also hyper-ventilating into a paper bag.
